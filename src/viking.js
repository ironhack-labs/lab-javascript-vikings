// Iteration 1: Soldier
// Modify the Soldier class and add 2 methods to it: attack(), and receiveDamage().

// should receive 2 arguments (health & strength)
// should receive the health property as its 1st argument
// should receive the strength property as its 2nd argument
// attack() method
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should return the strength property of the Soldier
// receiveDamage() method
// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (the damage)
// should remove the received damage from the health property
// shouldn't return anything

}

// Iteration 2: Viking
// A Viking is a Soldier with an additional property, their name. They also have a different
// receiveDamage() method and new method, battleCry().
// Modify the Viking class, have it inherit from Soldier, re-implement the receiveDamage()
// method for Viking, and add a new battleCry() method.
// inheritance
// Viking should extend Soldier
// class
// should receive 3 arguments (name, health & strength)
// should receive the name property as its 1st argument
// should receive the health property as its 2nd argument
// should receive the strength property as its 3rd argument
// attack() method
// (This method should be inherited from Soldier, no need to re-implement it.)
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should return the strength property of the Viking
// receiveDamage() method
// (This method needs to be re-implemented for Viking because the Viking version needs to have different return values.)
// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (the damage)
// should remove the received damage from the health property
// if the Viking is still alive, it should return "NAME has received DAMAGE points of damage"
// if the Viking dies, it should return "NAME has died in act of combat"
// battleCry() method
// Learn more about battle cries.
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should return "Odin Owns You All!"

class Viking extends Soldier {
  constructor(name, health, strength){
    super(health, strength);{

      }
    }
  }
  battleCry() {
    return "Odin Owns You All!";
  }
}

// Iteration 3: Saxon
// A Saxon is a weaker kind of Soldier. Unlike a Viking, a Saxon has no name. Their receiveDamage()
// method will also be different than the original Soldier version.
// Modify the Saxon, constructor function, have it inherit from Soldier and re-implement the receiveDamage()
// method for Saxon.
// inheritance
// Saxon should extend Soldier
// class
// you don't have to include constructor method since this class will inherit perfectly from the parents class,
// both, the health and the strength (it extends Soldier class ðŸ˜‰ )
// attack() method
// (This method should be inherited from Soldier, no need to re-implement it.)
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should return the strength property of the Saxon
// receiveDamage() method
// (This method needs to be re-implemented for Saxon because the Saxon version needs to have different return values.)
// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (the damage)
// should remove the received damage from the health property
// if the Saxon is still alive, it should return "A Saxon has received DAMAGE points of damage"
// if the Saxon dies, it should return "A Saxon has died in combat"

  constructor(health, strength) {
    super(health, strength);
  }
  receiveDamage(damage) {
    if (damage > 0) {
      this.health -= damage;
      if (this.health > 0) {
        return `A Saxon has received ${damage} points of damage`;
      } else {
        return `A Saxon has died in combat`;
      }
    }
  }
}

// BONUS- Iteration 4: War
// Now we get to the good stuff: WAR! Our War class will allow us to have a Viking army and a Saxon army
// that battle each other.
// Modify the War class and add 5 methods to its class:
// addViking()
// addSaxon()
// vikingAttack()
// saxonAttack()
// showStatus()
// class
// When we first create a War, the armies should be empty. We will add soldiers to the armies later.
// should receive 0 arguments
// should assign an empty array to the vikingArmy property
// should assign an empty array to the saxonArmy property
// addViking() method
// Adds 1 Viking to the vikingArmy. If you want a 10 Viking army, you need to call this 10 times.
// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (a Viking object)
// should add the received Viking to the army
// shouldn't return anything
// addSaxon() method
// The Saxon version of addViking().
// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (a Saxon object)
// should add the received Saxon to the army
// shouldn't return anything
// vikingAttack() method
// A Saxon (chosen at random) has their receiveDamage() method called with the damage equal to the strength
// of a Viking (also chosen at random). This should only perform a single attack and the Saxon doesn't get to attack back.
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should make a Saxon receiveDamage() equal to the strength of a Viking
// should remove dead saxons from the army
// should return result of calling receiveDamage() of a Saxon with the strength of a Viking
// saxonAttack() method
// The Saxon version of vikingAttack(). A Viking receives the damage equal to the strength of a Saxon.
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should make a Viking receiveDamage() equal to the strength of a Saxon
// should remove dead vikings from the army
// should return result of calling receiveDamage() of a Viking with the strength of a Saxon
// SUPER BONUS
// Since there is a lot of repetitive code in the previous two iterations, vikingAttack() and saxonAttack() try to
// create one generic method and call it in the case of vikingAttack and in the case of saxonAttack instead of
// using almost the same code for both methods. (This iteration doesn't have test, so ask your TAs and your
// instructor to give you feedback on the quality of your code after the refactor.)
// showStatus() method
// Returns the current status of the War based on the size of the armies.
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// if the Saxon array is empty, should return "Vikings have won the war of the century!"
// if the Viking array is empty, should return "Saxons have fought for their lives and survived another day..."
// if there are at least 1 Viking and 1 Saxon, should return "Vikings and Saxons are still in the thick of battle."
