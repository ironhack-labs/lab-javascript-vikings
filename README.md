#### `vikingAttack()` method

A `Saxon` (chosen at random) has their `receiveDamage()` method called with the damage equal to the `strength` of a `Viking` (also chosen at random). This should only perform a single attack and the `Saxon` doesn't get to attack back.

- should be a function
- should receive **0 arguments**
- should make a `Saxon` `receiveDamage()` equal to the `strength` of a `Viking`
- should remove dead saxons from the army
- should return **result of calling `receiveDamage()` of a `Saxon`** with the `strength` of a `Viking`

#### `saxonAttack()` method

The `Saxon` version of `vikingAttack()`. A `Viking` receives the damage equal to the `strength` of a `Saxon`.

- should be a function
- should receive **0 arguments**
- should make a `Viking` `receiveDamage()` equal to the `strength` of a `Saxon`
- should remove dead vikings from the army
- should return **result of calling `receiveDamage()` of a `Viking`** with the `strength` of a `Saxon`

### SUPER BONUS - Iteration 5

Since there is a lot of repetitive code in the previous two iterations, _vikingAttack()_ and _saxonAttack()_ try to create one _generic_ method and call it in the case of _vikingAttack_ and in the case of _saxonAttack_ instead of using almost the same code for both methods. (This iteration doesn't have test, so ask your TAs and your instructor to give you feedback on the quality of your code after the refactor.)

#### `showStatus()` method

Returns the current status of the `War` based on the size of the armies.

- should be a function
- should receive **0 arguments**
- **if the `Saxon` array is empty**, should return **_"Vikings have won the war of the century!"_**
- **if the `Viking` array is empty**, should return **_"Saxons have fought for their lives and survived another day..."_**
- **if there are at least 1 `Viking` and 1 `Saxon`**, should return **_"Vikings and Saxons are still in the thick of battle."_**

**Happy Coding!** 💙
